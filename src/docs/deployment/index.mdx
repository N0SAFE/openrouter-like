# Deployment

This section provides comprehensive guidance on deploying OpenRouter in production environments, ensuring scalability, reliability, and performance.

## Deployment Options

OpenRouter offers multiple deployment options to match your infrastructure needs:

- **Cloud API** - Standard cloud-hosted API with global distribution
- **Private Cloud** - Dedicated resources in our secure cloud environment
- **On-Premises** - Deploy within your own infrastructure for maximum control
- **Hybrid** - Combine cloud and on-premises deployments for optimal balance

## Production Readiness

Before deploying OpenRouter in a production environment, you should:

1. **Define SLAs** - Establish your requirements for uptime, latency, and throughput
2. **Plan capacity** - Determine expected usage patterns and capacity requirements
3. **Implement monitoring** - Set up appropriate monitoring and alerting
4. **Design for resilience** - Prepare fallback strategies and error handling
5. **Optimize cost** - Implement cost management strategies
6. **Security review** - Conduct a security assessment of your integration

For detailed guidance, see the [Production Readiness](/docs/deployment/production) documentation.

## Deployment Architecture

A typical OpenRouter deployment consists of several components:

```
┌──────────────┐       ┌──────────────┐       ┌──────────────┐
│  Your        │       │  OpenRouter  │       │  Model       │
│  Application │ ───── │  API Layer   │ ───── │  Providers   │
└──────────────┘       └──────────────┘       └──────────────┘
                              │
                      ┌───────┴───────┐
                      │ Monitoring &  │
                      │ Management    │
                      └───────────────┘
```

### Component Considerations

| Component | Considerations |
|-----------|---------------|
| API Layer | Load balancing, rate limiting, caching |
| Authentication | Key management, rotation, permissions |
| Monitoring | Metrics collection, alerting, logging |
| Cost Management | Usage tracking, budgeting, optimization |

## Scaling Strategies

OpenRouter can be scaled in several ways:

- **Horizontal scaling** - Distribute load across multiple instances
- **Regional deployment** - Deploy in multiple geographic regions
- **Load distribution** - Balance requests across model providers
- **Caching** - Reduce redundant requests with response caching
- **Asynchronous processing** - Decouple request handling from processing

For detailed guidance, see the [Scalability](/docs/deployment/scalability) documentation.

## High Availability

To achieve high availability with OpenRouter:

1. **Multi-region deployment** - Deploy across multiple geographic regions
2. **Redundant model access** - Configure multiple model providers
3. **Automatic failover** - Implement fallback strategies
4. **Health checking** - Regular monitoring of API and model availability
5. **Circuit breaking** - Automatically bypass unavailable resources

For detailed guidance, see the [High Availability](/docs/deployment/high-availability) documentation.

## Deployment Environments

### Multi-Region Deployment

For global applications, deploying OpenRouter across multiple regions improves:
- Latency by serving requests from the closest region
- Reliability through geographic redundancy
- Compliance with data residency requirements

For detailed guidance, see the [Multi-Region](/docs/deployment/multi-region) documentation.

### Private Cloud

Private cloud deployments offer:
- Enhanced security and isolation
- Dedicated resources with guaranteed capacity
- Custom configuration options
- Compliance with enterprise security policies

For detailed guidance, see the [Private Cloud](/docs/deployment/private-cloud) documentation.

### On-Premises

On-premises deployments provide:
- Maximum control over the infrastructure
- Data sovereignty and compliance
- Integration with existing security policies
- Offline operation capabilities

For detailed guidance, see the [On-Premises](/docs/deployment/on-premises) documentation.
