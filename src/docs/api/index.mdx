# API Reference

OpenRouter provides a unified API that lets you access models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and other providers through a single integration. Our API is designed to be compatible with OpenAI's API format while adding more capabilities.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to the following base URL:

```
https://api.openrouter.ai/v1

## API Endpoints

OpenRouter offers the following main endpoints:

| Endpoint | Description |

| [`/models`](/docs/api/models) | List and get information about available models |

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using an API key. Learn more in the [Authentication](/docs/api/authentication) section.
