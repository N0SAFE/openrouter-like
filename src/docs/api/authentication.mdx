# Authentication

All requests to the OpenRouter API require authentication using your API key. This guide explains how to authenticate your requests.

## API Key Authentication

Authentication with OpenRouter is done using Bearer token authentication in the HTTP Authorization header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Example Request with Authentication

Here's a complete example of an authenticated request to the chat completions endpoint:

```bash
curl https://api.openrouter.ai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "HTTP-Referer: https://your-app-or-website.com" \
  -d '{
    "model": "anthropic/claude-3-opus",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"}
    ]
  }'
```

## Required Headers

In addition to the Authorization header, OpenRouter requires:

- `Content-Type: application/json` - For requests with a JSON body
- `HTTP-Referer: https://your-app-or-website.com` - Your app's URL (helps with analytics and abuse prevention)

## Authentication Best Practices

### Keep Your API Key Secure

- Never expose your API key in client-side code or public repositories
- Store API keys in environment variables, not in your code
- Use different API keys for development and production environments

### Server-Side Requests

For security reasons, make API requests to OpenRouter from your backend server, not directly from client-side applications.

```javascript
// Example Node.js server-side request
const response = await fetch('https://api.openrouter.ai/v1/chat/completions', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'HTTP-Referer': 'https://your-app.com'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model: 'anthropic/claude-3-opus',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello!' }]
  })
});
```

## Authentication Errors

If authentication fails, you'll receive one of these error responses:

| Status Code | Description | Solution |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| 401 Unauthorized | Missing API key | Include your API key in the Authorization header |
| 403 Forbidden | Invalid API key | Check that your API key is correct and active |
| 429 Too Many Requests | Rate limit exceeded | Reduce request frequency or upgrade your plan |
