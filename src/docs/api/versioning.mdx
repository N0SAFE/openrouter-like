# API Versioning Policy

OpenRouter follows a structured versioning policy designed to provide stability for your applications while allowing our platform to evolve. This document outlines how we version our API and what changes you can expect.

## Version Structure

The OpenRouter API uses a simple major version scheme:

```
https://api.openrouter.ai/v1/chat/completions
```

The `v1` in the URL represents the major version of the API.

## Versioning Principles

Our versioning policy follows these key principles:

1. **API Stability**: Once a version is released, we maintain backward compatibility within that version
2. **Deprecation Notices**: We provide advance notice before deprecating features or versions
3. **Transition Periods**: We ensure reasonable time for migration between versions
4. **Semantic Changes**: Breaking changes are only introduced in new major versions
5. **Documentation**: All versions remain documented even after deprecation begins

## Compatibility Guarantees

### What We Won't Change Within a Version

- Endpoint URLs
- Required request parameters
- Response structure for existing fields
- Authentication methods
- Error codes and their meanings
- Data formats (JSON structure)

### What May Change Within a Version

- Adding new optional parameters
- Adding new response fields
- Extending enumerations with new values
- Adding new endpoints
- Performance improvements
- Bug fixes that don't change behavior

## Version Lifecycle

Each API version goes through the following lifecycle:

1. **Preview**: Initial release for developer testing, not for production use
2. **General Availability (GA)**: Stable version suitable for production
3. **Deprecated**: Version still works but will be removed in the future
4. **Sunset**: Version is no longer supported

### Lifecycle Timeframes

- **Preview to GA**: Typically 1-3 months
- **GA to Deprecation**: Minimum 12 months
- **Deprecation to Sunset**: Minimum 6 months

This gives you at least 18 months from general availability before a version is fully retired.

## Current Version Status

| Version | Status | Release Date | Deprecation Date | Sunset Date |
|---------|--------|--------------|------------------|-------------|
| v1      | GA     | Jan 15, 2023 | Not scheduled    | Not scheduled |

## Breaking Change Examples

Examples of changes that would require a new major version:

- Removing a required parameter
- Changing the structure of core response objects
- Modifying behavior in ways that break existing clients
- Removing endpoints
- Changing authentication mechanisms
- Altering error response formats

## Migration Process

When a new major version is released, we provide:

1. **Comprehensive Migration Guide**: Step-by-step instructions for updating
2. **Changelog**: Detailed list of changes between versions
3. **Migration Tools**: When possible, tools to help test compatibility
4. **Support Office Hours**: Scheduled sessions with our engineering team

### Migration Example

To migrate from a hypothetical `v1` to `v2`:

```diff
// Old v1 request
- POST https://api.openrouter.ai/v1/chat/completions
+ POST https://api.openrouter.ai/v2/chat/completions

// Request body changes
  {
    "model": "openai/gpt-4",
-   "prompt": "Hello, AI!",
+   "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, AI!"}],
    "max_tokens": 100
  }
```

## Version Notifications

We notify users about versioning changes through:

1. **Email Notifications**: Sent to account administrators
2. **Dashboard Alerts**: Displayed in the OpenRouter dashboard
3. **API Response Headers**: Deprecation warnings included in headers
4. **Change Log**: Published in our documentation
5. **Developer Newsletter**: Regular updates on platform changes

## Testing New Versions

You can test upcoming versions before migrating production applications:

### Version Preview

```
https://api.openrouter.ai/v2-preview/chat/completions
```

### Request Headers

You can test a new version while still using the current version URL:

```http
POST /v1/chat/completions HTTP/1.1
Host: api.openrouter.ai
X-OpenRouter-Version: v2-preview
```

## API Lifecycle Events

| Event | Notification Lead Time | Description |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|
| New Version Preview | Immediate | New version available for early testing |
| General Availability | 2 weeks | New version ready for production use |
| Deprecation Notice | 12 months | Version will be sunset in the future |
| End-of-Support Warning | 3 months | Final reminder before version sunset |
| Version Sunset | - | Version no longer accessible |

## Best Practices

1. **Monitor Notifications**: Subscribe to developer updates and monitor dashboard alerts
2. **Regular Updates**: Plan for regular maintenance windows to update API versions
3. **Version Pinning**: Explicitly specify the API version in your applications
4. **Feature Flags**: Implement feature flags to easily toggle between versions
5. **Test Compatibility**: Regularly test against preview versions to identify issues early

## Backward Compatibility Tools

We provide tools to help ensure backward compatibility:

1. **Version Simulator**: Test your current requests against upcoming versions
2. **Request Translator**: Automatically translate requests between versions
3. **Compatibility Reports**: Get reports on potential issues with your usage patterns

## Support for Legacy Versions

After a version is deprecated but before sunset:

1. **Critical Security Issues**: Will still be addressed
2. **Bug Fixes**: Only critical bugs will be fixed
3. **Performance**: No further optimizations will be made
4. **Features**: No new features will be added
5. **Support**: Limited technical support provided
