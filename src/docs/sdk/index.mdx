# SDK & Libraries

OpenRouter provides official and community-maintained client libraries to make integration even easier in your preferred programming language.

## Available Libraries

We currently offer official support for the following languages:

- [JavaScript/TypeScript](/docs/sdk/javascript)
- [Python](/docs/sdk/python)

Community-maintained libraries are available for additional languages. Check our [GitHub organization](https://github.com/openrouter) for the most up-to-date list.

## Why Use Our SDKs?

Our official client libraries offer several advantages:

- **Simplified Authentication** - API keys are handled securely
- **Type Safety** - Strong typing for request and response objects
- **Automatic Retries** - Built-in retry logic for transient errors
- **Streaming Support** - Easy handling of streaming responses
- **Rate Limiting** - Intelligent handling of rate limits
