# Billing & Usage

This guide explains how billing works on OpenRouter, how to monitor your usage, and tips for cost optimization.

## Billing Model

OpenRouter uses a pay-as-you-go model based on token usage:

1. **Input Tokens** - Charged based on the text you send to the models
2. **Output Tokens** - Charged based on the text generated by the models
3. **Different Rates** - Each model has different pricing for input and output tokens

## Understanding Token Pricing

Token pricing varies by model provider and capability level:

| Provider | Model Class | Input Price (per 1M tokens) | Output Price (per 1M tokens) |
|----------|------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| OpenAI   | GPT-4o     | $5.00                      | $15.00                       |
| OpenAI   | GPT-3.5    | $0.50                      | $1.50                        |
| Anthropic| Claude 3 Opus | $15.00                  | $75.00                       |
| Anthropic| Claude 3 Sonnet | $3.00                 | $15.00                       |
| Anthropic| Claude 3 Haiku | $0.25                  | $1.25                        |
| Google   | Gemini 1.5 Pro | $7.00                  | $21.00                       |

## Monitoring Usage

You can track your usage in several ways:

1. **Dashboard** - Real-time usage metrics in your account dashboard
2. **API** - Usage tracking via API for programmatic monitoring
3. **Export** - Download CSV/JSON usage reports for analysis
4. **Usage Alerts** - Set up notifications when approaching thresholds

### Viewing Detailed Usage

To view detailed usage information:

1. Log into your OpenRouter dashboard
2. Navigate to the "Usage" section
3. View breakdowns by:
   - Time period (hourly, daily, monthly)
   - Model provider
   - Specific model
   - Input vs. output tokens
   - Application (based on reference headers)

## Managing Costs

### Setting Budget Limits

To control costs:

1. Navigate to "Settings" > "Usage Limits"
2. Set monthly spending caps
3. Configure actions when caps are reached:
   - Pause API access
   - Send notifications
   - Switch to lower-cost models

### Cost Optimization Tips

1. **Use the right model for the job**
   - Don't use high-end models for simple tasks
   - Test different models to find the optimal price/performance ratio

2. **Optimize prompts**
   - Shorter prompts mean fewer input tokens
   - Clear instructions can reduce output verbosity

3. **Use caching**
   - Cache common responses to avoid repeated charges
   - Implement client-side caching for repeatable requests

4. **Implement rate limiting**
   - Prevent accidental API spam from user interfaces
   - Set per-user limits in multi-user applications

5. **Consider model routing**
   - Use cost-optimized routing to automatically select the most cost-effective model
   - Set up fallback chains from low-cost to high-cost models

## Payment Methods

OpenRouter accepts the following payment methods:

- Credit/Debit Cards (Visa, Mastercard, Amex)
- PayPal
- Wire Transfer (Enterprise plans)
- ACH (US customers)

## Billing FAQ

**Q: When am I charged?**
A: Charges are calculated daily and billed monthly. Enterprise customers may arrange custom billing cycles.

**Q: What happens if I exceed my free tier?**
A: You'll receive a notification and requests will be paused until you upgrade or the next billing cycle begins.

**Q: How do refunds work?**
A: Refunds for service issues are handled on a case-by-case basis. Contact support with your request.

**Q: Can I change plans mid-month?**
A: Yes, you can upgrade at any time. The new rate will be prorated for the remainder of the billing cycle.
