# API Keys

API keys are required to authenticate with the OpenRouter API. Each API key is unique to your account and gives you access to all supported models.

## Getting Your API Key

To obtain an API key:

1. **Create an account** on the [OpenRouter platform](https://openrouter.ai)
2. **Navigate to the API Keys** section in your dashboard
3. **Create a new API key** by clicking the "Create API Key" button
4. **Name your key** with a memorable description (e.g., "Development", "Production")
5. **Copy your API key** immediately - for security reasons, it will only be shown once

## API Key Security

Your API keys carry significant privileges, so be sure to keep them secure:

- **Never share your API keys** in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, or social media
- **Use environment variables** to store API keys in your applications
- **Create separate API keys** for different applications or environments
- **Rotate your API keys** periodically, especially after team member changes

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in all requests to the OpenRouter API as a Bearer token in the Authorization header:

```bash
curl https://api.openrouter.ai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "anthropic/claude-3-opus",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"}
    ]
  }'
```

## API Key Quota and Limits

Each API key has usage limits based on your subscription plan:

- **Free tier** users have a limited number of tokens per month
- **Paid plans** offer higher quotas and priority access to models
- **Rate limits** apply to prevent abuse (see [API reference](/docs/api) for details)

You can monitor your API key usage in the OpenRouter dashboard.

## Regenerating API Keys

If you believe your API key has been compromised:

1. **Immediately create a new key** in your dashboard
2. **Update all your applications** with the new key
3. **Delete the compromised key** to prevent unauthorized usage
